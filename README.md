# Sumthing Solver

A Python script that solves puzzles for **Sumthing** — a math game inspired by classic math puzzles, where you combine five numbers using basic math operators to hit a target number.

## 🔍 What It Does

Given 5 number cards and a target number, this script attempts to generate a valid arithmetic expression (using +, −, ×, ÷ and parentheses) that evaluates to the target. Each number must be used exactly once.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `Sumthing_Solver.py` file.
2. Run the script with Python.
3. Input your 5 numbers and target number.
4. Check out the results. 

## 💡 Example
**Cards:** 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
**Target:** 13

Output might include: 8+4+6-3-2 = 13

## 🎯 Game Rules Recap
Your goal is to make an equation with all five number cards that equals the target card.

- You must use all five number cards.
- Each number can only be used once.
- You can use +, −, ×, ÷ and parentheses.
- Don't forget about order of operations.
- Mental math only. No calculators allowed.
- No combining digits (e.g., turning 2 and 3 into 23).

When your equation is valid and equals the target, you win!
